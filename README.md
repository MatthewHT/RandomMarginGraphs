# RandomMarginGraphs
A short piece of code for generating random margins graphs from elections with large numbers of voters (i.e., as the number of voters goes to infinty). 
This implements a method described in the paper An Analysis of Random Elections with Large Numbers of Voters by Matthew Harrison-Trainor.
